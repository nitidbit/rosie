# Rosie

## Intro

Backup and restore your MySQL db and dependent local assets (e.g. PaperClip uploads)

Named after Rosie, the maid from the Jetsons (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_the_Robot_Maid#Rosie).  The gem provides two rake tasks which will backup or restore a MySQL database along with any dependent file system assets (like uploaded files from PaperClip) into a single timestamped file.
